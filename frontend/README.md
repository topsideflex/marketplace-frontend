# Marketplace Frontend (Vite + React, minimal)

## Quick start

1. Install:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start dev server:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000 npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

This is a simplified demo frontend that interacts with the backend APIs. For Render, set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to your backend's URL.
